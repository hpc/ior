Changes in IOR-2.10.3
 * bug 2962326 "Segmentation Fault When Summarizing Results" fixed
 * bug 2786285 "-Wrong number of parameters to function H5Dcreate" fixed
     (NOTE: to compile for HDF5 1.6 libs use "-D H5_USE_16_API")
 * bug 1992514 "delay (-d) doesn't work" fixed
Contributed by demyn@users.sourceforge.net
 * Ported to Windows. Required changes related to 'long' types, which on Windows
   are always 32-bits, even on 64-bit systems. Missing system headers and 
   functions acount for most of the remaining changes.
   New files for Windows:
    - IOR/ior.vcproj                - Visual C project file
    - IOR/src/C/win/getopt.{h,c}    - GNU getopt() support
   See updates in the USER_GUIDE for build instructions on Windows.
 * Fixed bug in incrementing transferCount
 * Fixed bugs in SummarizeResults with mismatched format specifiers
 * Fixed inconsistencies between option names, -h output, and the USER_GUIDE.
 
Changes in IOR-2.10.2:
Hodson, 8/18/2008:                                                          

The modifications to IOR-2.10.1 extend existing random I/O capabilities and 
enhance performance output statistics.                                      

   cli        script                  Description                             
-----      -----------------        ----------------------------------------
1)  -A N   testnum                - test reference number for easier test   
                                      identification in log files             
2)  -Q N   taskpernodeoffset      - for read tests. Use with -C & -Z options
                                      If -C (reordertasks) specified,         
                                      then node offset read by CONSTANT  N.   
                                      If -Z (reordertasksrandom) specified,   
                                      then node offset read by RANDOM >= N.   
3)  -Z     reordertasksrandom     - random node task ordering for read tests
                                      In this case, processes read            
                                      data written by other processes with    
                                      node offsets specified by the -Q option 
                                      and -X option.                          
4)  -X N   reordertasksrandomseed - random seed for -Z (reordertasksrandom) 
                                      If N>=0, use same seed for all iters    
                                      If N< 0, use different seed for ea. iter
5)  -Y     fsyncperwrite          - perform fsync after every POSIX write

Fixes in IOR-2.10.1:
 * added '-J' setAlignment option for HDF5 alignment in bytes; default value
   is 1, which does not set alignment
 * changed how HDF5 and PnetCDF calculate performance -- formerly each used
   the size of the stat()'ed file; changed it to be number of data bytes
   transferred.  these library-generated files can have large headers and
   filler as well as sparse file content
 * found potential overflow error in cast -- using IOR_offset_t, not int now
 * replaced HAVE_HDF5_NO_FILL macro to instead directly check if H5_VERS_MAJOR
   H5_VERS_MINOR are defined; if so, then must be HDF5-1.6.x or higher for
   no-fill usage.
 * corrected IOR_GetFileSize() function to point to HDF5 and NCMPI versions of 
   IOR_GetFileSize() calls
 * changed the netcdf dataset from 1D array to 4D array, where the 4 dimensions
   are: [segmentCount][numTasksWorld][numTransfers][transferSize]
   This patch from Wei-keng Liao allows for file sizes > 4GB (provided no
   single dimension is > 4GB).
 * finalized random-capability release
 * changed statvfs() to be for __sun (SunOS) only
 * retired Python GUI

Fixes in IOR-2.10.0.1:
 * Cleaned up WriteOrRead(), reducing much to smaller functions.
 * Added random capability for transfer offset.
 * modified strtok(NULL, " \t\r\n") in ExtractHints() so no trailing characters
 * added capability to set hints in NCMPI

Fixes in IOR-2.9.6.1:
 * for 'pvfs2:' filename prefix, now skips DisplayFreeSpace(); formerly this
   caused a problem with statvfs()
 * changed gethostname() to MPI_Get_processor_name() so for certain cases
   when gethostname() would only return the frontend node name
 * added SunOS compiler settings for makefile
 * updated O_DIRECT usage for SunOS compliance
 * changed statfs() to instead use statvfs() for SunOS compliance
 * renamed compiler directive _USE_LUSTRE to _MANUALLY_SET_LUSTRE_STRIPING

Fixes in IOR-2.9.5:
 * Wall clock deviation time relabeled to be "Start time skew across all tasks".
 * Added notification for "Using reorderTasks '-C' (expecting block, not cyclic,
   task assignment)"
 * Corrected bug with read performance with stonewalling (was using full size,
   stat'ed file instead of bytes transfered).

Fixes in IOR-2.9.4:
 * Now using IOR_offset_t instead of int for tmpOffset in IOR.c:WriteOrRead().
   Formerly, this would cause error in file(s) > 2GB for ReadCheck.  The
   more-commonly-used WriteCheck option was not affected by this.

Fixes in IOR-2.9.3:
 * Changed FILE_DELIMITER from ':' to '@'.
 * Any time skew between nodes is automatically adjusted so that all nodes
   are calibrated to the root node's time.
 * Wall clock deviation time is still reported, but have removed the warning
   message that was generated for this.  (Didn't add much new information,
   just annoyed folks.)
 * The '-j' outlierThreshold option now is set to 0 (off) as default.  To use
   this, set to a positive integer N, and any task who's time (for open,
   access, etc.) is not within N seconds of the mean of all the tasks will show
   up as an outlier.

Fixes in IOR-2.9.2:
 * Simple cleanup of error messages, format, etc.
 * Changed error reporting so that with VERBOSITY=2 (-vv) any error encountered
   is displayed.  Previously, this was with VERBOSITY=3, along with full test
   parameters, environment, and all access times of operations.
 * Added deadlineForStonewalling option (-D). This option is used for measuring
   the amount of data moved in a fixed time.  After the barrier, each task
   starts its own timer, begins moving data, and the stops moving data at a
   prearranged time.  Instead of measuring the amount of time to move a fixed
   amount of data, this option measures the amount of data moved in a fixed
   amount of time.  The objective is to prevent tasks slow to complete from
   skewing the performance.

Fixes in IOR-2.9.1:
 * Updated test script to run through file1:file2 cases.
 * Program exit code is now total numbers of errors (both writecheck and
   readcheck for all iterations), unless quitOnError (-q) is set.
 * For various failure situations, replace abort with warning, including:
   - failed uname() for platform name now gives warning
   - failed unlink() of data file now gives warning
   - failed fsync() of data file now gives warning
   - failed open() of nonexistent script file now gives warning
 * Changed labelling for error checking output to be (hopefully) more
   clear in details on errors for diagnostics.
 * Another fix for -o file1:file2 option.
 * Corrected bug in GetTestFileName() -- now possible to handle -o file1:file2
   cases for file-per-proc.

Fixes in IOR-2.9.0:
 * Improved checkRead option to reread data from different node (to avoid
   cache) and then compare both reads.
 * Added outlierThreshold (-j) option to give warning if any task is more than
   this number of seconds from the mean of all participating tasks.  If so, the
   task is identified, its time (start, elapsed create, elapsed transfer,
   elapsed close, or end) is reported, as is the mean and standard deviation for
   all tasks.  The default for this is 5, i.e. any task not within 5 seconds of
   the mean for those times is displayed.  This value can be set with
   outlierThreshold=<value> or -j <value>.
 * Correct for clock skew between nodes - if skew greater than wallclock
   deviation threshold (WC_DEV_THRESHOLD) in seconds, then broadcast root
   node's timestamp and adjust by the difference.  WC_DEV_THRESHOLD currently
   set to 5.
 * Added a Users Guide.
