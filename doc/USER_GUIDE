*******************
* 1.  DESCRIPTION *
*******************
IOR can be used for testing performance of parallel file systems using various
interfaces and access patterns.  IOR uses MPI for process synchronization.
IOR version 2 is a complete rewrite of the original IOR (Interleaved-Or-Random)
version 1 code.


******************
* 2. RUNNING IOR *
******************
Two ways to run IOR:

  * Command line with arguments -- executable followed by command line options.

    E.g., to execute:  IOR -w -r -o filename
    This performs a write and a read to the file 'filename'.

  * Command line with scripts -- any arguments on the command line will
    establish the default for the test run, but a script may be used in
    conjunction with this for varying specific tests during an execution of the
    code.

    E.g., to execute:  IOR -W -f script
    This defaults all tests in 'script' to use write data checking.

  * The Command line supports to specify additional parameters for the choosen API.
    For example, username and password for the storage.
    Available options are listed in the help text after selecting the API when running with -h.
    For example, 'IOR -a DUMMY -h' shows the supported options for the DUMMY backend.
    The options for the backend must be specified at last and are separated with
    two dashes '--'. Example: 'IOR -a DUMMY -- -c 1000' defines a delay for the
    file creation for the plugin. Currently, it is not possible to set these
    backend options using a command line script (-f option).



**************
* 3. OPTIONS *
**************
These options are to be used on the command line. E.g., 'IOR -a POSIX -b 4K'.
  -a S  api --  API for I/O, e.g., POSIX

  -d N  interTestDelay -- delay between reps in seconds
  -D N  deadlineForStonewalling -- seconds before stopping write or read phase
  -e    fsync -- perform fsync upon POSIX write close
  -E    useExistingTestFile -- do not remove test file before write access
  -f S  scriptFile -- test script name

  -u    uniqueDir -- use unique directory name for each file-per-process
  -U S  hintsFileName -- full name for hints file
  -v    verbose -- output information (repeating flag increases level)
  -V    useFileView -- use MPI_File_set_view
  -w    writeFile -- write file
  -W    checkWrite -- check read after write
  -x    singleXferAttempt -- do not retry transfer if incomplete
  -X N  reorderTasksRandomSeed -- random seed for -Z option
  -Y    fsyncPerWrite -- perform fsync after each POSIX write
  -z    randomOffset -- access is to random, not sequential, offsets within a file
  -Z    reorderTasksRandom -- changes task ordering to random ordering for readback


NOTES: * S is a string, N is an integer number.
       * For transfer and block sizes, the case-insensitive K, M, and G
         suffices are recognized.  I.e., '4k' or '4K' is accepted as 4096.

Various options are only valid for specific modules, you can see details when running $ ./ior -h
These options are typically prefixed with the module name, an example is: --posix.odirect

*********************
* 4. OPTION DETAILS *
*********************
For each of the general settings, note the default is shown in brackets.
IMPORTANT NOTE: For all true/false options below [1]=true, [0]=false

  * testFile             - name of the output file [testFile]
                           NOTE: with filePerProc set, the tasks can round
                                 robin across multiple file names '-o S@S@S'

  * hintsFileName        - name of the hints file []

  * repetitions          - number of times to run each test [1]

  * multiFile            - creates multiple files for single-shared-file or
                           file-per-process modes; i.e. each iteration creates
                           a new file [0=FALSE]

  * reorderTasksConstant - reorders tasks by a constant node offset for writing/reading neighbor's
                           data from different nodes [0=FALSE]

  * taskPerNodeOffset    - for read tests. Use with -C & -Z options. [1]
                           With reorderTasks, constant N. With reordertasksrandom, >= N

  * reorderTasksRandom   - reorders tasks to random ordering for readback [0=FALSE]

  * reorderTasksRandomSeed - random seed for reordertasksrandom option. [0]

  * quitOnError          - upon error encountered on checkWrite or checkRead,
                           display current error and then stop execution;
                           if not set, count errors and continue [0=FALSE]

  * numTasks             - number of tasks that should participate in the test
                           [0]
                           NOTE: 0 denotes all tasks

  * interTestDelay       - this is the time in seconds to delay before
                           beginning a write or read in a series of tests [0]
                           NOTE: it does not delay before a check write or
                                 check read

  * interIODelay         - this time in us (microseconds) after each I/O simulates computing time.

  * outlierThreshold     - gives warning if any task is more than this number
                           of seconds from the mean of all participating tasks.
                           If so, the task is identified, its time (start,
                           elapsed create, elapsed transfer, elapsed close, or
                           end) is reported, as is the mean and standard
                           deviation for all tasks.  The default for this is 0,
                           which turns it off.  If set to a positive value, for
                           example 3, any task not within 3 seconds of the mean
                           displays its times. [0]

  * intraTestBarriers    - use barrier between open, write/read, and close [0=FALSE]

                           file-per-process [0=FALSE]

  * writeFile            - writes file(s), first deleting any existing file [1=TRUE]
                           NOTE: the defaults for writeFile and readFile are
                                 set such that if there is not at least one of
                                 the following -w, -r, -W, or -R, it is assumed
                                 that -w and -r are expected and are
                                 consequently used -- this is only true with
                                 the command line, and may be overridden in
                                 a script

  * readFile             - reads existing file(s) (from current or previous
                           run) [1=TRUE]
                           NOTE: see writeFile notes

  * filePerProc          - accesses a single file for each processor; default
                           is a single file accessed by all processors [0=FALSE]

  * checkWrite           - read data back and check for errors against known
                           pattern; can be used independently of writeFile [0=FALSE]
                           NOTES: * data checking is not timed and does not
                                    affect other performance timings
                                  * all errors tallied and returned as program
                                    exit code, unless quitOnError set

  * checkRead            - reread data and check for errors between reads; can
                           be used independently of readFile [0=FALSE]
                           NOTE: see checkWrite notes

  * keepFile             - stops removal of test file(s) on program exit [0=FALSE]

  * keepFileWithError    - ensures that with any error found in data-checking,
                           the error-filled file(s) will not be deleted [0=FALSE]

  * useExistingTestFile  - do not remove test file before write access [0=FALSE]

  * segmentCount         - number of segments in file [1]
                           NOTES: * a segment is a contiguous chunk of data
                                    accessed by multiple clients each writing/
                                    reading their own contiguous data;
                                    comprised of blocks accessed by multiple
                                    clients
                                  * with HDF5 this repeats the pattern of an
                                    entire shared dataset

  * blockSize            - size (in bytes) of a contiguous chunk of data
                           accessed by a single client; it is comprised of one
                           or more transfers [1048576]

  * transferSize         - size (in bytes) of a single data buffer to be
                           transferred in a single I/O call [262144]

  * verbose              - output information [0]
                           NOTE: this can be set to levels 0-5 on the command
                                 line; repeating the -v flag will increase
                                 verbosity level

  * setTimeStampSignature - set value for time stamp signature [0]
                            NOTE: used to rerun tests with the exact data
                                  pattern by setting data signature to contain
                                  positive integer value as timestamp to be
                                  written in data file; if set to 0, is
                                  disabled

  * showHelp             - display options and help [0=FALSE]

  * storeFileOffset      - use file offset as stored signature when writing
                           file [0=FALSE]
                           NOTE: this will affect performance measurements

  * memoryPerNode        - Allocate memory on each node to simulate real
                           application memory usage.  Accepts a percentage of
                           node memory (e.g. "50%") on machines that support
                           sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES) or a size.  Allocation will
                           be split between tasks that share the node.

  * memoryPerTask        - Allocate secified amount of memory per task to
                           simulate real application memory usage.

  * maxTimeDuration      - max time in minutes to run tests [0]
                           NOTES: * setting this to zero (0) unsets this option
                                  * this option allows the current read/write
                                    to complete without interruption

  * deadlineForStonewalling - seconds before stopping write or read phase [0]
                           NOTES: * used for measuring the amount of data moved
                                    in a fixed time.  After the barrier, each
                                    task starts its own timer, begins moving
                                    data, and the stops moving data at a pre-
                                    arranged time.  Instead of measuring the
                                    amount of time to move a fixed amount of
                                    data, this option measures the amount of
                                    data moved in a fixed amount of time.  The
                                    objective is to prevent tasks slow to
                                    complete from skewing the performance.
                                  * setting this to zero (0) unsets this option
                                  * this option is incompatible w/data checking

  * randomOffset         - access is to random, not sequential, offsets within a file [0=FALSE]
                           NOTES: * this option is currently incompatible with:
                                    -checkRead
                                    -storeFileOffset
                                    -MPIIO collective or useFileView
                                    -HDF5 or NCMPI
  * summaryAlways        - Always print the long summary for each test.
                           Useful for long runs that may be interrupted, preventing
                           the final long summary for ALL tests to be printed.
  * summaryFile=File     - Output the summary to the file instead on stdout/stderr.
  * summaryFormat=FMT    - Choose the output format -- default, JSON, CSV

POSIX-ONLY:
===========
  * useO_DIRECT          - use O_DIRECT for POSIX, bypassing I/O buffers [0]

  * singleXferAttempt    - will not continue to retry transfer entire buffer
                           until it is transferred [0=FALSE]
                           NOTE: when performing a write() or read() in POSIX,
                                 there is no guarantee that the entire
                                 requested size of the buffer will be
                                 transferred; this flag keeps the retrying a
                                 single transfer until it completes or returns
                                 an error

  * fsyncPerWrite        - perform fsync after each POSIX write  [0=FALSE]
  * fsync                - perform fsync after POSIX write close [0=FALSE]

MPIIO-ONLY:
===========
  * preallocate          - preallocate the entire file before writing [0=FALSE]

  * useFileView          - use an MPI datatype for setting the file view option
                           to use individual file pointer [0=FALSE]
                           NOTE: default IOR uses explicit file pointers

  * useSharedFilePointer - use a shared file pointer [0=FALSE] (not working)
                           NOTE: default IOR uses explicit file pointers

  * useStridedDatatype   - create a datatype (max=2GB) for strided access; akin
                           to MULTIBLOCK_REGION_SIZE [0] (not working)

HDF5-ONLY:
==========
  * individualDataSets   - within a single file each task will access its own
                           dataset [0=FALSE] (not working)
                           NOTE: default IOR creates a dataset the size of
                                 numTasks * blockSize to be accessed by all
                                 tasks

  * noFill               - no pre-filling of data in HDF5 file creation [0=FALSE]

  * setAlignment         - HDF5 alignment in bytes (e.g.: 8, 4k, 2m, 1g) [1]

  * showHints            - show hint/value pairs attached to open file [0=FALSE]
                           NOTE: available in NCMPI only if PnetCDF is 1.2.0 or later

LUSTRE-SPECIFIC:
================
  * lustreStripeCount    - set the lustre stripe count for the test file(s) [0]

  * lustreStripeSize     - set the lustre stripe size for the test file(s) [0]

  * lustreStartOST       - set the starting OST for the test file(s) [-1]

  * lustreIgnoreLocks    - disable lustre range locking [0]

GPFS-SPECIFIC:
================
  * gpfsHintAccess       - use gpfs_fcntl hints to pre-declare accesses

  * gpfsReleaseToken     - immediately after opening or creating file, release
			   all locks.  Might help mitigate lock-revocation
			   traffic when many proceses write/read to same file.

BeeGFS-SPECIFIC (POSIX only):
================
  * beegfsNumTargets     - set the number of storage targets to use

  * beegfsChunkSize      - set the striping chunk size. Must be a power of two,

***********************
* 5. VERBOSITY LEVELS *
***********************
The verbosity of output for IOR can be set with -v.  Increasing the number of
-v instances on a command line sets the verbosity higher.

Here is an overview of the information shown for different verbosity levels:
  0 - default; only bare essentials shown
  1 - max clock deviation, participating tasks, free space, access pattern,
      commence/verify access notification w/time

********************
* 6. USING SCRIPTS *
********************

IOR can use a script with the command line.  Any options on the command line
will be considered the default settings for running the script.  (I.e.,
'IOR -W -f script' will have all tests in the script run with the -W option as
default.)  The script itself can override these settings and may be set to run
run many different tests of IOR under a single execution.  The command line is:

  IOR/bin/IOR -f script

In IOR/scripts, there are scripts of testcases for simulating I/O behavior of
various application codes.  Details are included in each script as necessary.

An example of a script:

****************************************
* 7. COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER VERSIONS *
****************************************
1)  IOR version 1 (c. 1996-2002) and IOR version 2 (c. 2003-present) are
    incompatible.  Input decks from one will not work on the other.  As version
    1 is not included in this release, this shouldn't be case for concern.  All
    subsequent compatibility issues are for IOR version 2.

2)  IOR versions prior to release 2.8 provided data size and rates in powers
    of two.  E.g., 1 MB/sec referred to 1,048,576 bytes per second.  With the
    IOR release 2.8 and later versions, MB is now defined as 1,000,000 bytes
    and MiB is 1,048,576 bytes.

3)  In IOR versions 2.5.3 to 2.8.7, IOR could be run without any command line
    options.  This assumed that if both write and read options (-w -r) were
    omitted, the run with them both set as default.  Later, it became clear
    that in certain cases (data checking, e.g.) this caused difficulties.  In
    IOR versions 2.8.8 and later, if not one of the -w -r -W or -R options is
    set, then -w and -r are set implicitly.

4)  IOR version 3 (Jan 2012-present) has changed the output of IOR somewhat,
    and the "testNum" option was renamed "refNum".

***************************
* 8. INCOMPRESSIBLE NOTES *
***************************

Please note that incompressibility is a factor of how large a block compression
algorithm uses.  The incompressible buffer is filled only once before write times,
so if the compression algorithm takes in blocks larger than the transfer size,
there will be compression.  Below are some baselines that I established for
zip, gzip, and bzip.

1) zip:  For zipped files, a transfer size of 1k is sufficient.

2) gzip: For gzipped files, a transfer size of 1k is sufficient.

3) bzip2: For bziped files a transfer size of 1k is insufficient (~50% compressed).
   To avoid compression a transfer size of greater than the bzip block size is required
   (default = 900KB). I suggest a transfer size of greather than 1MB to avoid bzip2 compression.

Be aware of the block size your compression algorithm will look at, and adjust the transfer size
accordingly.

*********************************
* 9. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS *
*********************************
HOW DO I PERFORM MULTIPLE DATA CHECKS ON AN EXISTING FILE?

  Use this command line:  IOR -k -E -W -i 5 -o file

  -k keeps the file after the access rather than deleting it
  -E uses the existing file rather than truncating it first
  -W performs the writecheck
  -i number of iterations of checking
  -o filename

  On versions of IOR prior to 2.8.8, you need the -r flag also, otherwise
  you'll first overwrite the existing file.  (In earlier versions, omitting -w
  and -r implied using both.  This semantic has been subsequently altered to be
  omitting -w, -r, -W, and -R implied using both -w and -r.)

  If you're running new tests to create a file and want repeat data checking on
  this file multiple times, there is an undocumented option for this.  It's -O
  multiReRead=1, and you'd need to have an IOR version compiled with the
  USE_UNDOC_OPT=1 (in iordef.h).  The command line would look like this:

  IOR -k -E -w -W -i 5 -o file -O multiReRead=1

  For the first iteration, the file would be written (w/o data checking).  Then
  for any additional iterations (four, in this example) the file would be
  reread for whatever data checking option is used.


HOW DOES IOR CALCULATE PERFORMANCE?

  IOR performs get a time stamp START, then has all participating tasks open a
  shared or independent file, transfer data, close the file(s), and then get a
  STOP time.  A stat() or MPI_File_get_size() is performed on the file(s) and
  compared against the aggregate amount of data transferred.  If this value
  does not match, a warning is issued and the amount of data transferred as
  calculated from write(), e.g., return codes is used.  The calculated
  bandwidth is the amount of data transferred divided by the elapsed
  STOP-minus-START time.

  IOR also gets time stamps to report the open, transfer, and close times.
  Each of these times is based on the earliest start time for any task and the
  latest stop time for any task.  Without using barriers between these
  operations (-g), the sum of the open, transfer, and close times may not equal
  the elapsed time from the first open to the last close.

  After each iteration (-i) IOR reports performance for that iteration, and
  those numbers include:

  - Bandwidth (described above)

  - IOPS: I/O rate (operations per second) achieved by all tasks given the total
    time spent in reading and writing the data.

  - Latency: computed by taking the average latency of all I/O operations from a
    single task. If ior is run with multiple tasks, then the latency reported is
    the minimum that was computed between all tasks.

HOW DO I ACCESS MULTIPLE FILE SYSTEMS IN IOR?

  It is possible when using the filePerProc option to have tasks round-robin
  across multiple file names.  Rather than use a single file name '-o file',
  additional names '-o file1@file2@file3' may be used.  In this case, a file
  per process would have three different file names (which may be full path
  names) to access.  The '@' delimiter is arbitrary, and may be set in the
  FILENAME_DELIMITER definition in iordef.h.

  Note that this option of multiple filenames only works with the filePerProc
  -F option.  This will not work for shared files.


HOW DO I BALANCE LOAD ACROSS MULTIPLE FILE SYSTEMS?

  As for the balancing of files per file system where different file systems
  offer different performance, additional instances of the same destination
  path can generally achieve good balance.

  For example, with FS1 getting 50% better performance than FS2, set the '-o'
  flag such that there are additional instances of the FS1 directory.  In this
  case, '-o FS1/file@FS1/file@FS1/file@FS2/file@FS2/file' should adjust for
  the performance difference and balance accordingly.


HOW DO I USE STONEWALLING?

  To use stonewalling (-D), it's generally best to separate write testing from
  read testing.  Start with writing a file with '-D 0' (stonewalling disabled)
  to determine how long the file takes to be written.  If it takes 10 seconds
  for the data transfer, run again with a shorter duration, '-D 7' e.g., to
  stop before the file would be completed without stonewalling.  For reading,
  it's best to create a full file (not an incompletely written file from a
  stonewalling run) and then run with stonewalling set on this preexisting
  file.  If a write and read test are performed in the same run with
  stonewalling, it's likely that the read will encounter an error upon hitting
  the EOF.  Separating the runs can correct for this.  E.g.,

  IOR -w -k -o file -D 10  # write and keep file, stonewall after 10 seconds
  IOR -r -E -o file -D 7   # read existing file, stonewall after 7 seconds

  Also, when running multiple iterations of a read-only stonewall test, it may
  be necessary to set the -D value high enough so that each iteration is not
  reading from cache.  Otherwise, in some cases, the first iteration may show
  100 MB/s, the next 200 MB/s, the third 300 MB/s.  Each of these tests is
  actually reading the same amount from disk in the allotted time, but they
  are also reading the cached data from the previous test each time to get the
  increased performance.  Setting -D high enough so that the cache is
  overfilled will prevent this.


HOW DO I BYPASS CACHING WHEN READING BACK A FILE I'VE JUST WRITTEN?

  One issue with testing file systems is handling cached data.  When a file is
  written, that data may be stored locally on the node writing the file.  When
  the same node attempts to read the data back from the file system either for
  performance or data integrity checking, it may be reading from its own cache
  rather from the file system.

  The reorderTasksConstant '-C' option attempts to address this by having a
  different node read back data than wrote it.  For example, node N writes the
  data to file, node N+1 reads back the data for read performance, node N+2
  reads back the data for write data checking, and node N+3 reads the data for
  read data checking, comparing this with the reread data from node N+4.  The
  objective is to make sure on file access that the data is not being read from
  cached data.

    Node 0: writes data
    Node 1: reads data
    Node 2: reads written data for write checking
    Node 3: reads written data for read checking
    Node 4: reads written data for read checking, comparing with Node 3

  The algorithm for skipping from N to N+1, e.g., expects consecutive task
  numbers on nodes (block assignment), not those assigned round robin (cyclic
  assignment).  For example, a test running 6 tasks on 3 nodes would expect
  tasks 0,1 on node 0; tasks 2,3 on node 1; and tasks 4,5 on node 2.  Were the
  assignment for tasks-to-node in round robin fashion, there would be tasks 0,3
  on node 0; tasks 1,4 on node 1; and tasks 2,5 on node 2.  In this case, there
  would be no expectation that a task would not be reading from data cached on
  a node.


HOW DO I USE HINTS?

  It is possible to pass hints to the I/O library or file system layers
  following this form:
    'setenv IOR_HINT__<layer>__<hint> <value>'
  For example:
    'setenv IOR_HINT__MPI__IBM_largeblock_io true'
    'setenv IOR_HINT__GPFS__important_hint true'
  or, in a file in the form:
    'IOR_HINT__<layer>__<hint>=<value>'
  Note that hints to MPI from the HDF5 or NCMPI layers are of the form:
    'setenv IOR_HINT__MPI__<hint> <value>'


HOW DO I EXPLICITY SET THE FILE DATA SIGNATURE?

  The data signature for a transfer contains the MPI task number, transfer-
  buffer offset, and also timestamp for the start of iteration.  As IOR works
  with 8-byte long long ints, the even-numbered long longs written contain a
  32-bit MPI task number and a 32-bit timestamp.  The odd-numbered long longs
  contain a 64-bit transferbuffer offset (or file offset if the '-l'
  storeFileOffset option is used).  To set the timestamp value, use '-G' or
  setTimeStampSignature.


HOW DO I EASILY CHECK OR CHANGE A BYTE IN AN OUTPUT DATA FILE?

  There is a simple utility IOR/src/C/cbif/cbif.c that may be built.  This is a
  stand-alone, serial application called cbif (Change Byte In File).  The
  utility allows a file offset to be checked, returning the data at that
  location in IOR's data check format.  It also allows a byte at that location
  to be changed.


HOW DO I CORRECT FOR CLOCK SKEW BETWEEN NODES IN A CLUSTER?

  To correct for clock skew between nodes, IOR compares times between nodes,
  then broadcasts the root node's timestamp so all nodes can adjust by the
  difference.  To see an egregious outlier, use the '-j' option.  Be sure
  to set this value high enough to only show a node outside a certain time
  from the mean.
