Building with DAOS API
----------------------

At step 1 above, one must specify "--with-daos". If the DAOS
headers and libraries are not installed at respective system
default locations, then one may also needs to set CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS accordingly.

Running with DAOS API
---------------------

One must specify an existing pool using "-O
daospool=<pool_uuid>". IOR must be launched in a way that
attaches the IOR process group to the DAOS server process group.

One must also specify a container UUID using "-o
<container_uuid>". If the "-E" option is given, then this UUID
shall denote an existing container created by a "matching" IOR
run. Otherwise, IOR will create a new container with this UUID.
In the latter case, one may use uuidgen(1) to generate the UUID
of the new container.

When benchmarking write performance, one likely do not want
"-W", which causes the write phase to do one additional memory
copy for every I/O. This is due to IOR's assumption that when a
DAOS_Xfer() call returns the buffer may be released. Therefore,
random data is written when "-W" is absent, while data is copied
from IOR buffers when "-W" is present.

See doc/USER_GUIDE for all options and directives. Note that not
all combinations of options are supported.

Examples that should work include:

  - "ior -a DAOS -w -W -o <container_uuid> -O
    daospool=<pool_uuid>,daospoolsvc=<svc_ranks>" writes into a new container
    and verifies the data, using default daosRecordSize, transferSize,
    daosStripeSize, blockSize, daosAios, etc.

  - "ior -a DAOS -w -W -r -R -o <container_uuid> -b 1g -t 4m -C -O
    daospool=<pool_uuid>,daospoolsvc=<svc_ranks>,daosrecordsize=1m,
    daosstripesize=4m, daosstripecount=256,daosaios=8" does all IOR tests and
    shifts ranks during checkWrite and checkRead.

  - "ior -a DAOS -w -r -o <container_uuid> -b 8g -t 1m -C -O
    daospool=<pool_uuid>,daospoolsvc=<svc_ranks>,daosrecordsize=1m,daosstripesize=4m,
    daosstripecount=256,daosaios=8" may be a base to be tuned for performance
    benchmarking.
